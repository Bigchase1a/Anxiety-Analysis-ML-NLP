## Introduction

Anxiety disorders are among the most common mental health issues worldwide. This project aims to utilize machine learning and NLP techniques to analyze text data, helping in the prediction and detection of anxiety levels. By understanding the language patterns associated with anxiety, we can create effective tools for mental health support.

## Technologies Used

- **Machine Learning Frameworks**: Scikit-learn, TensorFlow
- **Natural Language Processing**: NLTK, SpaCy
- **Data Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn
- **Programming Language**: Python
- **Development Environment**: Jupyter Notebook

## Features

- **Anxiety Detection**: Predict anxiety levels based on text input.
- **Keyword Extraction**: Identify key phrases and terms related to anxiety.
- **Model Comparison**: Evaluate multiple machine learning models for performance.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple command-line interface for easy interaction.

## Getting Started

To get started with this project, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Bigchase1a/Anxiety-Analysis-ML-NLP.git
cd Anxiety-Analysis-ML-NLP
```

Next, install the required dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

You can find the latest releases [here](https://github.com/Bigchase1a/Anxiety-Analysis-ML-NLP/releases). Download the necessary files and execute them to begin.

## How to Use

1. **Input Data**: Prepare your text data in a CSV file. The file should contain a column for the text and another for the anxiety level.
2. **Run the Model**: Use the provided scripts to train the model. For example:

```bash
python train_model.py --input your_data.csv
```

3. **Make Predictions**: Once the model is trained, you can make predictions on new text data.

```bash
python predict.py --input new_data.csv
```

## Models and Algorithms

This project implements several machine learning algorithms, including:

- **Logistic Regression**: A simple yet effective model for binary classification tasks.
- **Naive Bayes**: A probabilistic model based on Bayes' theorem, suitable for text classification.
- **Random Forest**: An ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees for improved accuracy.
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**: A powerful model that finds the optimal hyperplane for classification tasks.

Each model is evaluated based on accuracy, precision, and recall, providing insights into their performance.

## Results

The results section will display the performance metrics for each model. Hereâ€™s a sample output:

| Model                | Accuracy | Precision | Recall |
|----------------------|----------|-----------|--------|
| Logistic Regression   | 85%      | 80%       | 75%    |
| Naive Bayes          | 82%      | 78%       | 70%    |
| Random Forest        | 90%      | 88%       | 85%    |
| Support Vector Machine| 87%      | 84%       | 80%    |

These results indicate that the Random Forest model performed the best in this analysis.
